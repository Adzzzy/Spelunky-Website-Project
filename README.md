# Spelunky Website Project
A simple informational fan website called "The Spelunker" made for the game Spelunky in a team of two in year 11 IT in high school.

The website focuses on HTML and CSS and was initially built using CoffeeCup HTML Editor, before migrating to a code editor. A simple CSS template was also incorporated to create a starting wireframe.

The website is fully static, containing no elements that are generated dynamically by a server running a programming language or database. Everything runs directly on the client-side in the browser, based on the HTML & CSS of the included files.

### Usage
The site has been deployed using GitHub pages and can be viewed here: https://adzzzy.github.io/Spelunky-Website-Project/
