            <h3 class="heading-3">Olmec Run</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"> There are two ways to beat Spelunky, the first and most common being an Olmec Run. This involves beating all 16 levels without dying. You will encounter 4 areas when doing this run, The Mines, The Jungle, The Ice Caves, and The Temple. The enemies in The Mines are usually pretty easy to deal with as they can all be beaten by avoiding their attacks and jumping on them (see <a href="monsters.html">Monsters</a>). The main hazards to watch out for are spikes and arrow traps. Spikes will instantly kill the player when they land on them, and arrow traps will do 2 damage and need to be triggered by an object. The jungle introduces tough enemies such as <a href="monsters.html#mantrap">mantraps</a> and <a href="monsters.html#tikiman">tiki men</a>. It also introduces tiki traps which can spike the player for 4 damage when they get near, the best way to avoid them is <a href="items.html#springshoes">spring shoes</a> or ropes. The Ice Caves consists of many floating bits of land, which makes <a href="items.html#ropes">ropes</a>, a cape, or a jetpack crucial. Enemies such as <a href="monsters.html#yeti">yetis</a> and mammoths make the ice caves particularily tricky as yetis can throw the player into the abyss and <a href="monsters.html#mammoth">mammoths</a> can freeze the player. The temple is by far the hardest area in an Olmec Run. It has enemies like <a href="monsters.html#mummy">mummies</a>, which need to be jumped over before they vomit flies at the player. The enemy <a href="monsters.html#anubis">Anubis</a> shoots psychic rings that kill the player if they make contact. It also has hazards like crush traps, which travel in a straight line towards the player to crush them. Additionally, there is lava that can instanly kill the player. These hazards can be avoided using <a href="items.html#bombs">bombs</a> and ropes. The final challenge in an Olmec Run is the boss, <a href="monsters.html#olmec">Olmec</a>, himself. Olmec must be defeated by breaking the floor until Olmec falls in the lava below.

            <h3 class="heading-3">Hell Run</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"> A Hell Run is like an Olmec Run, except it requires following some specific steps along the way in order to get into <a href="places.html#hell">Hell</a>. This includes getting the <a href="items.html#udjateye">Udjat Eye</a> in The Mines, to help the player find the Black Market in The Jungle. Then, the player must obtain the <a href="items.html#ankh">Ankh</a> in the Black Market, and die in the stage with the Moai Head to get the <a href="items.html#hedjet">Hedjet</a>. The player must then kill <a href="monsters.html#anubis">Anubis</a> and take the sceptre he wields. Following this, the player uses the <a href="items.html#sceptre">Sceptre</a> and Hedjet to enter the City of Gold. The player must then take the <a href="items.html#bookofthedead">Book of the Dead</a> and kill Anubis II, who guards it. From here, the player needs to make Olmec land in the lava underneath the Hell entrance so the player can enter. Once the player enters hell, they have access to <a href="monsters.html#vlad">Vlad's Amulet</a> which makes hell easier. The most dangerous enemy in hell is the <a href="monsters.html#devil">Devil</a>. The player should also manoeuvre carefully around spike balls, as they spin quickly and can damage the player if they're to slow. After that, the final challenge is the boss <a href="monsters.html#yama">Yama</a>. The best way to defeat Yama is with <a href="items.html#paste">sticky bombs</a> or a shotgun, although, even with these, Yama's attacks still require practice to avoid.

  <h3 class="heading-3 tips">Useful Tips</h3>
  <ul class="tips">
  	  <li>Olmec can be defeated using only 5 bombs if they are placed very carefully.</li>
	  <li>Yama can be defeated easily by hiding under a block on the far left or far right side of the stage and continously shooting with the shotgun.</li>
	  <li>Arrows from Arrow Traps can be whipped if timed correctly.</li>
	  <li>The player can safely float down onto spikes if they are using a cape or parachute.</li>
	  <li>The player can cling onto a block by crawling off it.</li>
	  <li>If a shopkeeper is angered, there will be a shopkeeper waiting at the end of every level to kill you.</li>
	  <li>If a rope is hanging down into a group of spikes, the player can safely descend onto the spikes using the rope.</li>
	  <li>A bomb will destroy more blocks if the player picks it up and places it down again.</li>
	  <li>The Black Market can be found without the Udjat Eye as it can spawn poking out of a wall or the player can get lucky and blow up the correct tile.</li>
