Items in Spelunky have many attributes and properties. You can find equipment: items such as bombs which you can use many times; accessories: items which give you a passive bonus; objects: items you can pick up and throw; and weapons: which can be used in combat against monsters. Picking up and using many different items is essential for surviving in all the environments Spelunky has to offer, and make every game of Spelunky fun and exciting.<br>

            <p class="paragraph"><br>Environmental hazards aren't the only danger the Spelunkers encounter on their adventure. The caves of Spelunky are filled with all sorts of dangerous beasts, evil monsters, and angry old men. Monsters can be simple, little spiders that you can find around the place, or dangerous, massive bosses that can kill you in one hit. Monsters also include all the NPCs and characters you meet along the way on your adventures, including Shopkeepers, Hired Hands and Damsels.

            <p class="paragraph">Traps are dangerous environmental hazards designed to punish unwanted trespassers.
There are many varieties of traps in the caves, all of which can quickly end an unwary player's game.
Even experienced players will frequently find themselves on the receiving end of these malicious devices.

It should be noted that enemies killed by traps - either by accident, or a result of the player luring (or forcing) the monster into harm's way - aren't counted among the player's kills on the scoreboard.<br>

            <p class="paragraph">There are many places to explore in the caves of Spelunky, each filled with unique terrain, monsters, traps and Level Feelings.
There are four main areas that the Spelunker must navigate to reach Olmec, in addition to a bonus area where the Spelunker can face the game's final boss.

There are also several bonus levels which offer powerful items as their prize if the Spelunker can survive them.<br>
